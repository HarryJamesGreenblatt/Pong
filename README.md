## Recent Updates

### Game Data Tracking
- The game now tracks detailed game data, including the number of volleys, scores, time taken for each game, and the scorer.
- The `timeTaken` is now calculated relative to each game, ensuring accurate tracking of game durations.
- Each game's end time is recorded and displayed in a human-readable format.

### Code Enhancements
- Added a new `endTime` property to the game data to facilitate accurate time tracking.
- Transformed the game data to include a readable end time using JavaScript's `Date` object.
- Updated the `Pong` component to reset the `startTime` at the beginning of each game and calculate the `timeTaken` relative to the previous game's end time.
